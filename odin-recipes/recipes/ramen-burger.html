    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Instant ramen becomes a nearly-instant burger bun in this fun, and tasty, spin on a traditional hamburger season.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2-3 ounce packages instant ramen noodles, flavor packet discarded</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 slices american cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chile-garlic sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups arugula</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to boil; add ramen noodles. Boil, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender, about 3 minutes. Drain. Allow noodles to cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Beat 2 eggs in bowl; season with salt and pepper. Stir noodles into eggs until evenly coated. Divide noodles into 6 burger-size ramekins or bowls. Place a sheet of plastic wrap directly over noodles and stack another bowl on top to flatten noodles. Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until firm, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix beef, soy sauce, and sesame oil in bowl. Divide beef mixture into three equal portions and shape into patties.</li>
        <li>Fry each ramen bun, without moving noodles, in hot oil until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Flip each bun and continue frying until crips, 3 to 5 minutes more. Famen bun should be cripsy on one side and slightly softer on the other. Transfer buns to large plate with the crispy side up.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the same skillet used to fry ramen over medium heat. Cook beef patties until burgers are lightly pink in the center, 3 to 5 minute per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Arrange a slice of American cheese over each burger and continue to cook until melted, about 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Mix ketchup and chile-garlic sauce in a small bowl; spread mixture over the crispy side of each ramen bun. Divide arugula over 3 ramen buns. Place burgers over arugula.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1 teaspoon oil in a small skillet over medium-high heat; fry remaining eggs one at a time, adding more oil as needed, until yolk is almost firm, about 1 minutes per side. Place egg over patty and top with remaining bun.</li>
    </ol>
